# DBMS Alpha Stage (12/9-13, 16-17)

## Steps
- ~~A - Create full-blown test of functionality on AVT experimental branch for others to play around with (12/9)~~
- ~~B - Figure out what to do with the current price list generation workflow (originally using Canva) (12/10-12)~~
  - Solution for generating the price lists - Generate the price lists directly from Airtable (or through a process of improving the styling - HTML/CSS in a PDF template)
Benefits: complete ownership/control, scalability, reduced manual effort, improved accuracy, enhanced consistency, improved sustainability, long-term efficiency
