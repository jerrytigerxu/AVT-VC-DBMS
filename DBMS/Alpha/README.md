# DBMS Alpha Stage (12/9-13, 16-17)

## Steps
- ~~A - Create full-blown test of functionality on AVT experimental branch for others to play around with (12/9)~~
- B - Figure out how to update Canva price lists dynamically (having Airtable be the central hub for all CRUD operations that affect everything else) OR even forgo Canva entirely and just generate price lists directly from the Airtable data (HTML and CSS within a PDF template) (12/10-12)
- C - Recreate Airtable integration functionality on SO staging site (two full stock product tables) (12/11-13)
- D - Plan out full implementation with the approval of the marketing team and others (12/13)
