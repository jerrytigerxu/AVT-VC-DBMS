# Beta (12/16-25)

- A) ~~Full implementation of AVT stock product pages on the production site (create exact replicas of the existing stock pages as private published pages) (12/16-18) (we as the marketing team decided that we need to purchase the "Team" price tier for Airtable (because of the expanded data limit and other capabilities~~
- ~~B) POC for price list generation workflow (12/19-23) | await the purchase of the "Team" tier of Airtable before finishing every single stock page~~
- ~~C) Address "critical error" that appears on Wordpress (find out how to replicate it, then figure out the source)~~
  - ~~Signing out of Wordpress or out of Airtable doesn't directly cause an issue -> it might be a time matter (also test between drafts and published pages) -> for drafts the shortcode could be executed many times in the background because of autosaves and revision history while for published pages the shortcode only runs once~~
- D) Full implementation of basic Airtable setup & price list generation workflow (12/24-31)
