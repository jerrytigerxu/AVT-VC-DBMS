# Beta (12/16-25)

- A) ~~Full implementation of AVT stock product pages on the production site (create exact replicas of the existing stock pages as private published pages) (12/16-18) (we as the marketing team decided that we need to purchase the "Team" price tier for Airtable (because of the expanded data limit and other capabilities~~
- B) POC for price list generation workflow (12/19-20) | await the purchase of the "Team" tier of Airtable before finishing every single stock page
- C) Address "critical error" that appears on Wordpress (find out how to replicate it, then figure out the source)
  - Signing out of Wordpress or out of Airtable doesn't directly cause an issue -> it might be a time matter (also test between drafts and published pages)
- D) Full implementation of price list generation workflow (12/24-25)
